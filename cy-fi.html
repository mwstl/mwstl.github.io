                                During an elective course, Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Innovation (BUS 238), my
                                team chose to focus on two UN Sustainable Development Goals. Namely, Goal 4 (Quality
                                Education), and Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Our proposed product is
                                Canadian Youth Finance (Cy-Fi), an educational initiative that envisions what we would
                                have wished to learn in secondary school, with the goal to provide a foundation of
                                financial
                                literacy for Canadian Youth. My teammates were Nicolas Ramirez, Lucas Kim, and Simon

                                        We first selected our topic problem: <strong>Students are having financial
                                            problems</strong>. An
                                        issue that our entire team could understand and empathise with. To begin
                                        tackling the
                                        problem, we started with secondary research to understand the topic, associated
                                        issues, and possible root causes. We found that ultimately, all of the problems
                                        could be linked to a <i>lack of financial education</i>.

                                        The focus of our project is on secondary and post-secondary students. To
                                        gather a deeper understanding of this issue, we created an anonymous survey to
                                        understand students financial situation and their financial competency. As some
                                        questions may be sensitive, respondents could choose whether to respond or not.

                                        We found that most respondents were students with the majority (91%) being under
                                        23 years of age. We also asked about the respondents income, how much they
                                        saved, how much they invested, and their knowledge on personal finances.

                                        To summarise some outstanding results from the survey, we found that over 60% of
                                        respondents did
                                        not invest and percent of their income if they were working. 80% of
                                        respondents did not remember learning about personal finances in school. The
                                        question we wanted to know the most was what resources people used to learn
                                        about finances. Here, we found that most of our respondents learned about
                                        finances from their parents, the internet, and social media platforms. 98% of
                                        respondents believed that financial literacy education should be mandatory in
                                        school.

                                        We also conducted some interviews to gain further, more personal insight into
                                        our audience's situation. We had some pre-determined questions to ensure that we
                                        could gather the same information from each interviewee. During my interviews I
                                        also probed my interviewees further, asking more specific questions in response

                                        From the interviews, we found that most interviewees tuition was paid for
                                        in-full or partially by their parents. Additionally, some paid for their tution

                                        in-person events (conventions, conferences...). The interviewees favoured a

                                        and community could be integrated. Additionally, our interviewees believed that
                                        the website in combination with social media content and newsletters could be a
                                        way to quickly expand the user base and provide short-form, easily digestible

                                        All together, these solutions would help solve two major pain points. First,
                                        that there is not enough information on personal finance catered for young
                                        Canadians. Secondly, that reliable and authoritative information was not
                                        centralized, but rather scattered around on the internet, meaning that our
                                        interviewees had to spend a lot of time researching to find and verify
                                        information.

                                        For our solution, we considered bringing in financial experts from government,
                                        national and provincial student loan organizations, financial advisors, and
                                        professors. At the start, we would create a free program that would teach
                                        optimal short and long term financial habits in various topics such as taxes,
                                        investing, credit and debt, salary, renting, and more.

                            This was a fun project to work on. As finance is something I had recently been highly
                            interested in, I felt invested in developing a solution proposal and am happy with the
                            result. Throughout the course, I learnt new ways to look at the world and problems, and
                            methods for how
                            to innovate solutions.
