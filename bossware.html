                                For our final project we were given a list of topics to choose from, my group chose
                                Bossware with a focus on themes of surveillance. This speculative critical design
                                project had the goal of questioning, challenging, or proposing alternative narratives of
                                a technological future. By the end of the project we were to produce a short narrative
                                video and a "wild poster." My team mates were Kajal Kajal, Oscar Waizel, Greg Withers,
                                and
                                Daniel Yeo.

                                        Before we could begin designing for our scenario, we first needed to have a
                                        clear understanding of the topic, issues, discussions, and hidden complexities
                                        related to Bossware and surveillance. In our first meeting, we discussed what we
                                        already knew about Bossware, our preconceived notions, and current thoughts
                                        about the topic. Greg had experience in a previous job with surveillance apps
                                        and was able to give personal insights and experiences. Throughout the
                                        discussion I took notes to reference later.

                                        After our first brainstorm session, we then split various points into different

                                        Existing Projects, and our Team's Interest.

                                        After collecting and organizing our ideas, we began ideating different worlds
                                        and scenarios around the ideas we identified. I used grey and dark-grey sticky
                                        notes.

                                        My first concept was a world where everything is under surveillance. This
                                        includes details such as where someone is looking, how they're breathing,
                                        moving, their heartbeat, and more. If we lived in a world like this, what types
                                        of values would be embodied? How would social structure and economies work?

                                        My second concept is a world contrary to the first, where everyone is trusted to
                                        work autonomously. In this world, what types of jobs would exist?
                                        How would companies be structured? How will the technologies of the world
                                        develop? Would there be any technologies less developed than our current

                                        The third world I thought of was one where people worked for enjoyment. How
                                        would passion driven careers shape the world? What types of surveillance would
                                        exist in this environment? What about the boring and mundane but essential jobs
                                        we don't often think about?

                                        My final world was one that valued hyper-productivity. What is the meaning of

                                        After creating and worldbuilding some of the possible scenarios, we then began
                                        imagining the world from the perspective of someone living in it. For example
                                        Greg's idea (we progressed further with this concept), "imagine your're a
                                        middle-aged
                                        farmer growing crops in the year 2092." From here, we also thought of a possible
                                        solution: "you can cross-reference weather patterns and climate anomalies with
                                        virtual scans of your seedlings ([using a] hand-held scanner)..."

                                        Greg created the posters with AI and during the in-class critique, our
                                        classmates didn't immediately understand the idea. however, when they took time
                                        to read and ponder, they could begin to grasp our concept. During the critiques
                                        I was also looking around the classroom and noticed microphones hanging from the
                                        ceiling and cameras pointing towards the front and rear of the classroom. I
                                        thought... why would they need these in the classroom? So as an adaptation of
                                        our posters, I thought that it would be interesting to somehow integrate the
                                        physical environment and have the posters interact with the surrounding space to
                                        better convey our message. Say, a poster of someone pointing towards
                                        a physical surveillance device. What type of discussions could be brought about
                                        with this?

                                        The second deliverable we were tasked with was creating a short video to further
                                        explore our speculative world. We chose to continue with the more retro-styled
                                        themes of the poster and reflect them in the video to tie them together.

                                        During the class critique, some of our classmates noted that they felt a
                                        disconnect between the style of the video and themselves. As the video felt
                                        outdated, this gave the impression that surveillance was a problem of the past.
                                        On the other hand, our professor understood the thematical choices and felt that
                                        it was
                                        relatable. Perhaps due to the media that we were accustomed to growing up?

                                        remedy this, we sought to find ways to contextualize the video in the now. As a
                                        result, we ended up splitting the video into three parts: the start, the
                                        historical propaganda, and the current rebellion.

                                        At the start, the video begins with the YouTube homepage to situate the video as

                                        propaganda section is meant to present Bossware and surveillance in a positive
                                        light, as if brainwashing the viewer. We played into certain tropes and themes
                                        to make this more understandable. I wrote the script for this section using an
                                        acronym to make it easy to remember, Productivity, Results, Insight, Security,
                                        Management (P.R.I.S.M.). Greg used an AI voice cloner to copy the voice of an
                                        old radio or television commentator.

                                        The rebellion section then brings out discourse about Bossware, and questions
                                        the benefits of such a system. It is situated in a more modern setting and is
                                        meant to blatantly highlight issues regarding these systems. For this part of
                                        the script, I modified a draft that Greg wrote and followed a more
                                        conversational style. I used WellSaidLabs to generate this part of the
                                        voiceover.

                                        To polish off our deliverables, I thought about how we could tie in the poster
                                        and the video. While commuting back from class, I noticed a speed limit sign
                                        covered up by cardboard and thought... what if our poster was vandalized?
                                        Wouldn't this fit the rebellion theme? As such, we also proposed a poster design
                                        that looks like someone splattered graffiti over, which would both catch
                                        passerby's attention and also help bring up possible discussions around the
                                        topic.
                                        For the video, I gave some suggestions
                                        on editing with video examples that I had seen before, and these edits were
                                        ultimately envisioned by my team mate.

                            different values, we chose to create an extreme alternative reality to highlight possible
