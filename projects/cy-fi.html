                <p>
                    During an elective course, Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Innovation (BUS 238), my team chose
                    to focus on two UN Sustainable Development Goals. Namely, Goal 4 (Quality Education), and Goal 8
                    (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Our proposed product is Canadian Youth Finance (Cy-Fi), an
                    educational initiative that envisions what we would have wished to learn in secondary school, with
                    the goal to provide a foundation of financial literacy for Canadian Youth. My teammates were Nicolas
                    Ramirez, Lucas Kim, and Simon Wong Chung.

            <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <p>
                We first selected our topic problem: <strong>Students are having financial problems</strong>. An issue
                that our entire team could understand and empathise with. To begin tackling the problem, we started with
                secondary research to understand the topic, associated issues, and possible root causes. We found that
                ultimately, all of the problems could be linked to a lack of financial education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus of our project is on secondary and post-secondary students. To gather a deeper understanding
                of this issue, we created an anonymous survey to understand students financial situation and their
                financial competency. As some questions may be sensitive, respondents could choose whether to respond or
                not.

            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>
                We found that most respondents were students with the majority (91%) being under 23 years of age. We
                also asked about the respondents income, how much they saved, how much they invested, and their
                knowledge on personal finances.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/238-business/238-survey-saving.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                To summarise some outstanding results from the survey, we found that over 60% of respondents did not
                invest and percent of their income if they were working.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/238-business/238-survey-invest.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                80% of respondents did not remember learning
                about personal finances in school. The question we wanted to know the most was what resources people
                used to learn about finances.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/238-business/238-survey-knowledge.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Here, we found that most of our respondents learned about finances from
                their parents, the internet, and social media platforms. 98% of respondents believed that financial
                literacy education should be mandatory in school.
            </p>

            <p>
                These results reflect the sample of respondents in our survey, and may not be the same in other
                situations.

            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>
                We also conducted some interviews to gain further, more personal insight into our audience's situation.
                We had some pre-planned questions to ensure that we could gather the same information from each
                interviewee. During my interviews I also probed my interviewees further, asking more specific questions
                in response to their answers to gain deeper insight.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the interviews, we found that most interviewees tuition was paid for in-full or partially by their
                parents. Additionally, some paid for their tution and expenses with student loans and by income from
                part-time jobs.

        <div class="details-section">
            <h3>Solution Development</h3>
            <p>
                After collecting and analysing our survey and interview data, we began developing possible solutions
                using the SCAMPER framework. We then proposed a few of the viable ideas to our interviewees, some of
                which were a podcast, and in-person events (conventions, conferences...). The interviewees favoured a
                website platform for education where videos, practice questions and solutions, and community could be
                integrated. Additionally, our interviewees believed that the website in combination with social media
                content and newsletters could be a way to quickly expand the user base and provide short-form, easily
                digestible knowledge.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/238-business/238-solution-dev.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                All together, these solutions would help solve two major pain points. First, that there is not enough
                information on personal finance catered for young Canadians. Secondly, that reliable and authoritative
                information was not centralized, but rather scattered around on the internet. This meant that
                interviewees who were interested in personal finance had to spend a lot of time researching to find and
                verify information.
            </p>
            <p>
                For our solution, we considered bringing in financial experts from government, national and provincial
                student loan organizations, financial advisors, and professors. At the start, we would create a free
                program that would teach optimal short and long term financial habits in various topics such as taxes,
                investing, credit and debt, salary, renting, and more.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/238-business/238-business-model.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                For a premium edition, we also thought about adding in more in-depth lecture series based around the
                topics in the core curriculum, and being able to ask questions directly to the experts.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help visualize our project, I created some mockups to show during our presentations.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>

            <p>
                This was a fun project to work on. As finance is something I had recently been highly interested in, I
                felt invested in developing a solution proposal and am happy with the result. Throughout the course, I
                learnt new ways to look at the world, problems, and methods for how to innovate solutions. Special
                thanks to our professor, Kate Dilworth and my awesome teammates!
