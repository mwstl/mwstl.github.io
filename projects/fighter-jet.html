                    As a part of my co-op in the Immersive Tech (IX Labs) <a
                        href="https://ixlabs.ca/uncontained/">UNCONTAINED</a> project, I was tasked with making
                    a fighter
                    jet that could be implemented into Unity for use in a potential sequel to the game. This project was
                    guided by my
                    supervisor, Ken Ha.

            <h3>Designing the Jet</h3>
            <p>
                I first started by gathering references of fighter jets and aircrafts. These images included real
                aircraft, concept sketches, and other ideas from around the internet.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/fighter-jet/fighter_reference-gathering.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Based on these sketches, I started making some thumbnail sketches to ideate on the shape of the jet.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/fighter-jet/fighter_sketches.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Afterwards in Blender, I kitbashed together some prototype jet models, blocking out some low poly
                concepts, and doing some shape explorations with the models.
            </p>

            <h3>Modelling</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/fighter-jet/fighter_concept_01_copy.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Ken gave me feedback on the designs and then gave me a concept sketch based on one of the draft models I
                made. I then modelled the fighter jet based on his sketch in Blender, keeping the topology to quads and
                tris. I thought about how to reduce the polygons as much as I could while still retaining details, and
                what details could be conveyed through texture instead.
            </p>

            <h3>Texturing the Jet</h3>
            <p>
                From here, I moved onto using Adobe Susbtance Painter to texture the model. As this was my first time
                using
                Substance Painter, I spent a bit of time getting used to the tools and drafting different ideas about
                how I
                would like the jet to appear.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/fighter-jet/fighter_texture-test.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                After getting used to the tools and settings, I moved onto figuring out what the fighter jet should look
                like. Using a basic round brush and a negative height, I carved out some paneling detail and decals
                along
                the model. Then, I decided on two colours - a base dark grey, and a secondary green that I masked onto
                certain areas.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/fighter-jet/fighter_texture1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                I then began adding in some impact and damage details along areas
                that
                would recieve wear and tear damage if the fighter jet were to be flying into battle. I also went back
                and
                modified the geometry and UVs for certain areas that appeared to stretch.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/fighter-jet/fighter_texture3.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                I also made a high poly model and bake mapped it to the low poly model's texture. After some more
                pointers
                and refining, I ended up with a fully textured, game ready fighter jet!

            <h3>VFX</h3>
            <p>
                After creating the jet, Ken also had me try a hand at some bullet shooting VFX. I imported the model
                into
                Unity and used Photoshop and Embergen to create some textures.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/fighter-jet/fighter_final.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                I quite enjoyed the process of making the fighter jet. I learnt some new tools to add to my skillsets,
                and
                am happy with the final outcome. I was able to use Substance Painter, which I had been looking into
                trying
                out for a little while, and found that I quite enjoyed the process of texturing. I also practiced some
                of my
                topology skills, improved my understanding of UVs for a game ready asset, and tried my hand at some VFX.
