                    For our course final project, my group wanted to create an app around the theme of music. A project
                    concern was avoiding the common music player or guided meditation app, and we ended up deciding on a
                    music equipment tracker for high school music directors. My team members were Dongmei Han, Jinous
                    Safaei, Mark Duinkerke, and Yifei Wang.

            <h3>Project Planning</h3>
            <p>
                We first started with secondary research from online sources. Some topics that we researched were
                surrounding instrument care, library archiving, existing school equipment tracking tools, and instrument
                rental and maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also conducted some interviews with some people we knew who were involved with music and music
                directing. I conducted 3 interviews with my Air Cadet friends who participated in the squadron band and
                their school bands. Some of my interviewees were ensemble directors and others were section leads.
                During the interviews, I used some pre-determined questions to guide the conversation and then asked
                more insightful questions in response to the interviewees' answers.
            </p>

            <p>
                After determining the topic domain, issues, and similar existing apps, we began thinking of what screens
                and processes the user would be going through while during the process of tracking instruments. This
                includes cataloguing the instruments, assigning them and returning them from students, and the students
                and ensembles currently in the school.

            <p>
                After determining the topic domain, issues, and similar existing apps, we began thinking of what screens
                and processes the user would be going through while during the process of tracking instruments. This
                includes cataloguing the instruments, assigning them and returning them from students, and the students
                and ensembles currently in the school.

            <img src="../assets/img/334-app/334-app-pages.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                To further contextualize the issue, we also created a user experience map to analyse the thoughts and
                opportunities throughout the different phases of the instrument tracking process.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/334-app/334-user-journey-experience.png" alt="">
            <p>
                During our first design proposal, we were given feedback that the app was somewhat boring and were asked
                to find a way to make the cataloguing process quicker, instead of feeling like filling out a form. To
                some extent, some of the information needed to keep track of the instrument could not be avoided, but we
                thought of using solutions like using photos and computer vision to help expedite the process.

            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
            <p>
                Based on feedback we recieved, I also designed some more experimental designs that broke away from our
                initial design and were meant to
                explore possible interactions in a more unconstrained way.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/334-app/334-design-experiments.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                I also redesigned the instrument info pages to show the most relevant information at a glance without
                requiring the user to scroll. Additionally, we decided to add in some events to the app where the music
                directors could assign a groups or specific instruments to an event. I ended up making 3 variations of
                the event page.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="details-section">
            <h3>Refining</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout this process, we conducted user testing with friends to see how well the app worked. Some
                issues our users encountered involved the onboarding process, cataloguing efficiency, returning,
                assigning, and request process, and the events page. We then rethought and redesigned these processes to
                alleviate those issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                When users first open the app, it was blank because there are no instruments in the catalogue. As a
                result, our users were left feeling lost and confused right from the start. To solve this, we created a
                brief onboarding process with popups that indicate what the different buttons do and what process the
                user should be going through to catalogue and assign or return instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
                To fix the other issues, we focused how to better guide the user through the processes (cataloguing,
                returning, assigning, requesting...). Some of these were resolved through better copy and blank state
                instructions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="details-section">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
                This project was quite work intensive, requiring us to ideate the app concept, features, screens, all
                while designing the interface and prototyping the interactions. I found that I enjoyed the process of
                designing the visual interfaces the most fun, especially while creating some experimental iterations. It
                was interesting getting feedback from the teaching team and thinking of solutions to make the experience
                more streamlined and intuitive for the user. Although the final prototype did not turn out as polished
                as I had initially hoped, I am still quite satisfied with the result of our project.
