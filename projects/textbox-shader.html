                    This shader is meant to work on a plane object and is driven through the shader without relying on
                    Unity's Canvas. It can scale to any dimension to accomodate varying lengths of text and paragraphs.

            <h3>Masking Techniques</h3>
            <p>
                The shader works by using masks to display certain parts of the HUD texture, and then constraining them
                to the corners or edges. In my first iteration, I used separate textures for each of the corners. I was
                also taught a technique by Farbod Tabei, where I could to use a colors (where the image is split
                into 3x3, and each section is a different color) to mask out a single image rather than splitting the
                HUD texture into multiple images, saving resources.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/shader/textbox-shader-graph.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Most of the shader is powered through calculations that use the Object Scale node to modify the Texture
                Coodinate Tiling and Offset. Below is a portion of the graph that shows the horizontal middle
                calculations.

            <p>
                The texbox image can be changed directly through the material. Although the final shader uses multiple
                textures for the masks, the user only has to change the first texture. The horizontal and vertical
                middle sections can also be adjusted if needed.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <img src="../assets/img/shader/textbox-shader.gif" alt="">
            <p>
                This shader was an interesting exercise as it was more mathematically based. Although part of the
                process was
                experimentation, I thought through and observed what changes were happening as the plane was being
                scaled. The colour masking technique was also an interesting one as I had not known about it before.
