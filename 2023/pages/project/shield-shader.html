                        As a technical artist, the first tool I was tasked with creating was a shield shader that could
                        be applied to any mesh. The shader would react according to any bullet object that hits the
                        mesh. Dependig on the location of the impact, the shader will visually ripple outwards and glow
                        to show that the shield has been hit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within the <em>UNCONTAINED</em> project, we used Unity and the Amplify Shader Graph (ASG) plugin
                        for many
                        shaders because it allows us to utilise node-based shaders rather than code. At the time of
                        starting, I had no prior knowledge of how to use Unity, much less ASG. However, I had some
                        experience with Blender's material nodes, Cinema4D's XPresso editor, and generative coding in
                        Processing, so I had some rough ideas about how to approach the task.

                                Starting with a basic spherical mesh, I created a simple shader that utilises Fresnel
                                and Screen
                                Position Edge nodes to fade off towards the centre and appear more vividly around the
                                edges. The
                                visuals can be tweaked through the material using exposed property values. I also added
                                an
                                animated grid that moves vertically along the mesh.
                            </p>
                            <img src="../../img/shader/shield-shader-base.png" alt="">
                            <p>
                                The next step was figuring out how to make the visual impact. I started with simple
                                black and
                                white values (0-1), as this could be adapted for use as a multiplier for sprite image
                                strengths
                                or displacement values. The basic idea behind this is to get the location of the hit on
                                the mesh
                                and then compare it with the surrounding UV or vertex positions to see if they are
                                within a
                                certain distance of the Hit Location. I created a script that takes Unity's
                                InverseTransformPoint function to convert the world vector (position according to the
                                whole
                                world) of the collision to a local vector (position according to the mesh/game object)
                                that is
                                then passed through into the shader's property.
                            </p>
                            <img src="../../img/shader/shield-shader-impact.png" alt="">
                            <p>
                                Additionally, I added in a fading edge gradient that can be controlled so the impact
                                gradually
                                fades off to the centre. The above three images use a mid-high value for the Hit Size
                                and show
                                the difference between how the edge fading can be tweaked. This is also a timed effect
                                controlled through the script, so that the impact will fade after a certain time.
                            </p>
                            <img src="../../img/shader/shield-shader-code.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
                                I consulted my colleague, Lawrence Yip, for help with the collision tags. As the project
                                was
                                already fleshed out, certain game objects were linked to different tags/layers, and some
                                of
                                these did not interact with each other. By making sure that the shield object and the
                                bullet
                                object were on layers that were interactable, I was able to get the collisions to work.
                            </p>
                            <img src="../../img/shader/shield-shader-displacement-graph.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
                                The next step was to add some displacement to the mesh at the hit location. Because I
                                used 0-1
                                values for the visuals, I was able to simply multiply the hit effect I made earlier with
                                a
                                controllable displacement strength to make it seem as if the impact had physically
                                distorted the
                                mesh.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At this point, the shader was mostly done, but to extend the usefulness of the mesh, I
                                was asked
                                to adapt it for more complex meshes and to allow for sprite sheets or textures to be
                                used rather
                                than a simple sphere.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I received help from another colleague, Stefan Bloedorn, in getting the images to
                                correctly
                                display according to the UV mapped meshes. This works by rotating the texture node's UV
                                positioning according to the vertex position of the Hit Location, effectively enabling
                                the
                                effect to work on complex meshes and UVs.

                        Throughout the making of the shield shader, I learnt the basics of how to use Unity and delved
                        into the more complex creation of a shader tool. One thing I kept in mind while creating the
                        shader was how a game artist or developer might want to customise the shader. This led me to use
                        float controls to easily iterate and modify the shader according to different needs and
                        stylistic choices, and to make these options readily available through the material using
                        exposed property values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I stretched my skills through the various layers of creating the shield shader, from the basic
                        visuals to the collision impact positioning, timed effects, and displacement. By implementing
                        various skillsets, from programming to node-based development, and through continual iteration,
                        I managed to create a working shield shader.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I learnt some workflow management and organisation skills as textures, shaders,
                        materials, meshes, and so forth followed naming conventions and were sorted into folders. This
                        made it easy to find previous examples in the project that I occasionally referenced to get some
                        inspiration on how to tackle the shader.
